<h2>Conditions</h2>

  The password length entered should be in between 4 and 20.
  There are options for the user to select whether they want to include alphabets and/or numbers and/or symbols. Atleast one of the given options must be selectd.
  If either of the above two are not true, then a warning will be generated.

<h2>Password generation algorithm</h2>
<p>
  The password's character pool is created by combining letters, numbers, and symbols based on which checkboxes the user has selected.
  The password is built by repeatedly picking random characters from the allowed set until the desired length is reached.
